## ðŸ’» Project summary

This project is a highly scalable micro-service to handle all the notifications (Email/SMS/WhatsApp) that you would require to schedule for contact from your small-business. It uses Amazon's SQS queuing service, SendGrid's email API and Twilio WhatsApp and SMS API to schedule notifications. Support would be added for other service-providers as the project evolves.

## ðŸš© Features

- Simple/Bulk WhatsApp notification through a single API call.
- Simple/Bulk SMS notification through a single API call.
- Simple/Bulk rich text Email through a single API call.
- Rate limiter for streamlining bulk notification requests.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

Project was built using **Node.js**, AWS Services, Docker and the following dependencies:

- **[AWS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk)** - Develop and deploy applications with the AWS SDK for JavaScript. The SDK provides first-class TypeScript support and makes it easy to call AWS services using idiomatic JavaScript APIs to build Node. js, web and mobile web apps.

- **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)** - It is a zero dependency module that loads environment variables from an .env file into process.env. The configuration storage in the environment separate from the code is based on The Twelve-Factor App methodology.

- **[JS Yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-yaml)** - Helps javascript to read yaml files and consequently render them more easily.

- **[Sendgird Mail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sendgrid/mail)** - This is a dedicated service for interaction with the mail endpoint of the SendGrid v3 API.

- **[SQS Consumer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqs-consumer)** - Build SQS-based applications without the boilerplate. Just define an async function that handles the SQS message processing.

- **[Twilio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twilio)** - Package to interact with the Twilio api to send messages by whatssap and SMS

- Clone this project

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jhonywalkeer/notification-microservice.git
$ cd notification-microservice

```

Now, after configure...

- Create environment file

```bash
vim .env
```

Provide all the values as specified in `sample_env.sh`

- Start the micro-service

```
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
